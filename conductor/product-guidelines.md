# Product Guidelines

## 1. Tone and Voice
*   **Professional & Direct:** The interface should communicate information efficiently and clearly, prioritizing data accuracy and speed of comprehension.

## 2. Data Presentation Strategy
*   **Hybrid Approach:**
    *   **Visual-First:** Key metrics and trends should be immediately visible via charts, maps (specifically the Navojoa electoral map), and KPI cards.
    *   **Drill-Down Capability:** High-level summaries should allow users to click through to granular details.
    *   **Detail-Oriented Tables:** For administrative tasks (like the hierarchical table), provide robust data grids with filtering, sorting, and editing capabilities.

## 3. Visual Identity
*   **Consistent with Existing Design:** The new features (Consolidated Analytics, Geographic Analysis) must seamlessly integrate with the current visual language of the application.
    *   Maintain current color palettes, typography, and spacing.
    *   Reuse existing UI components (buttons, cards, inputs) to ensure coherence.
