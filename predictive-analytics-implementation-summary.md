#### 4. **Add electoral territory expansion suggestions based on coverage analysis**
- âœ… Enhanced `calculateTerritorialExpansion()` with sophisticated coverage gap analysis
- âœ… Implemented priority ranking based on coverage gaps (Alta: >20%, Media: 10-20%, Baja: <10%)
- âœ… Added expansion potential calculations and realistic timeframe estimates
- âœ… Created resource requirement estimates (movilizadores needed per region)
- âœ… Added budget estimates for territorial expansion initiatives
- âœ… Implemented strategic recommendations for each expansion opportunity

#### 5. **Implement registration velocity forecasting for campaign planning**
- âœ… Created comprehensive "PronÃ³stico de Velocidad de Registro" section
- âœ… Added real-time velocity tracking with current, weekly, and monthly projections
- âœ… Implemented campaign scenario modeling (Optimista +25%, Base, Conservador -15%)
- âœ… Created impact factor analysis (leader efficiency, territorial coverage, churn risk)
- âœ… Added confidence-based forecasting with data quality indicators
- âœ… Implemented trend visualization and direction indicators

### ðŸ”§ Technical Enhancements

#### **Data Integration**

#### **Forecasting Algorithms**
- Implemented trend analysis using moving averages
- Added confidence scoring based on data quality and recency
- Created expansion potential calculations using realistic growth models
- Enhanced resource optimization with performance-based recommendations

### ðŸ“Š Key Features Added

#### **Registration Velocity Forecasting**
```typescript
// Enhanced velocity calculation with trend analysis
const calculateRegistrationVelocity = () => {
  const recentDays = analytics.dailyRegistrations.slice(-7);
  const firstHalf = recentDays.slice(0, 3).reduce((sum, day) => sum + day.count, 0) / 3;
  const secondHalf = recentDays.slice(-3).reduce((sum, day) => sum + day.count, 0) / 3;
  
  const trendDirection = secondHalf > firstHalf * 1.1 ? 'increasing' : 
                       secondHalf < firstHalf * 0.9 ? 'decreasing' : 'stable';
  
  return {
    current: Math.round(avgDailyProjection || currentVelocity),
    trend: trendDirection,
    confidence: calculatedConfidence,
    weeklyAverage: weeklyCalculation
  };
};
```

#### **Electoral Territory Expansion Analysis**
```typescript
// Enhanced territorial expansion with resource estimates
const calculateTerritorialExpansion = () => {
  return lowCoverageAreas.map(area => {
    const gap = area.target - area.coverage;
    const expansionPotential = Math.min(gap * 2, 100 - area.coverage);
    
    return {
      region: area.region,
      currentCoverage: area.coverage,
      target: area.target,
      gap,
      expansionPotential,
      priority: gap > 20 ? 'Alta' : gap > 10 ? 'Media' : 'Baja',
      estimatedTimeframe: timeframeCalculation,
      resourcesNeeded: Math.ceil(gap / 5)
    };
  });
};
```

#### **Campaign Scenario Planning**
- **Optimista (+25%)**: Enhanced growth scenario with increased resources
- **Base (actual)**: Current velocity maintained
- **Conservador (-15%)**: Conservative scenario accounting for potential challenges
